## About Me
I am a positive-thinking person who possesses a balance of analytical skills and strong interpersonal abilities. My organized, structured, and detail-oriented approach stems from my background as a cloud engineer and data scientist. I thrive on solving problems and collaborating with others.

I hold a Master's degree in Information Technology from the University of Mumbai and have worked as a Technical Associate and Data Scientist. My experience spans over two years in managing cloud infrastructure, automation, and software testing, focusing on enhancing system performance and reliability.

Now, I aim to leverage my technical and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying testing methodologies and tools through online courses and applying my knowledge to real-world projects.

I am eager to gain hands-on experience in testing operational products, a crucial step towards my career goal of becoming a mid-level software tester in the next two years.
